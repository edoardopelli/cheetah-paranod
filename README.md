PARANOD - # P.A.R.A.N.O.D. Project

## Description

The P.A.R.A.N.O.D. project is an intelligent and versatile application designed to streamline the analysis of dependencies in Java projects based on a `pom.xml` file and organize this information in a Neo4j database. The application exposes two intuitive and powerful REST services, allowing developers to automate and optimize the dependency management process in their projects.

### 1. Pom.xml Analysis Service

- **Endpoint:** `/paranod/pom/analyzer/upload`
- **Method:** `POST`
  
This service enables users to upload a `pom.xml` file through a POST HTTP request. The associated controller analyzes the file and returns a detailed JSON containing information about the project dependencies, including details such as artifact name, version, and any transitive dependencies.

### 2. Insert into Neo4j Service

- **Endpoint:** `/paranod/rawdata/aggregate`
- **Method:** `POST`

This service accepts JSON generated by the analysis service (`/paranod/pom/analyzer/upload`) as input. The associated controller processes the JSON and inserts dependency information into the Neo4j database. This process allows developers to visualize and interact with the dependency structure through a graphical model in Neo4j.

## How to Use P.A.R.A.N.O.D.

1. Upload the `pom.xml` file using the `/paranod/pom/analyzer/upload` service.
2. Obtain the JSON with dependency information returned by the service.
3. Use the `/paranod/rawdata/aggregate` service, providing the generated JSON, to insert dependencies into the Neo4j database.
4. Explore the dependency structure through Neo4j for a better understanding and management of the project.

With P.A.R.A.N.O.D., simplifying and optimizing the management of Java project dependencies is now a seamless and automated process, allowing developers to focus more on creating high-quality code without worrying about the complexities of dependencies.

## Project Status

The P.A.R.A.N.O.D. project is currently in development. While the core functionalities are available, additional features and improvements are being actively worked on.
