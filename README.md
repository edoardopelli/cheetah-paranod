PARANOD - Pom.xml Analyzer and Neo4j Dependencies Organizer

# P.A.R.A.N.O.D. Project

## Description

The P.A.R.A.N.O.D. project is an intelligent and versatile application designed to streamline the analysis of dependencies in Java projects based on a `pom.xml` file and organize this information in a Neo4j database. The application exposes two intuitive and powerful REST services, allowing developers to automate and optimize the dependency management process in their projects.

### 1. Pom.xml Analysis Service

- **Endpoint:** `/paranoid/pom/analyzer/upload`
- **Method:** `POST`
  
This service enables users to upload a `pom.xml` file through a POST HTTP request. The associated controller analyzes the file and returns a detailed JSON containing information about the project dependencies, including details such as artifact name, version, and any direct dependencies.

### 2. Insert into Neo4j Service

- **Endpoint:** `/paranoid/rawdata/aggregate`
- **Method:** `POST`

This service accepts JSON generated by the analysis service (`/paranoid/pom/analyzer/upload`) as input. The associated controller processes the JSON and inserts direct dependency information into the Neo4j database. It's important to note that the project currently does not insert transitive dependencies into Neo4j, focusing solely on those dependencies directly imported by the project.

## How to Use P.A.R.A.N.O.D.

1. Upload the `pom.xml` file using the `/paranoid/pom/analyzer/upload` service.
2. Obtain the JSON with direct dependency information returned by the service.
3. Use the `/paranoid/rawdata/aggregate` service, providing the generated JSON, to insert direct dependencies into the Neo4j database.
4. Explore the dependency structure through Neo4j for a better understanding and management of the project.
